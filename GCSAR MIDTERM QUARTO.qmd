## Campus Biodiversity Data

A rich biodiversity on college campuses has been shown to increase the well-being of students, professors, and staff members. This project looks at biodiversity data in bird species richness, across several academic institutions from east coast states in the United States including Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. To understand the full effect that bird species richness has on college campuses, several relationships between other variables such as graduation rate, institution size, Carnegie classification, and sector were researched.


```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
# code written by Gabriel Cabrera
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
#Version 1.4.3 of readxl was used
```

Data is from the eBird database created by Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a database that allows users to add their bird observations from college campuses across the world, and the Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) a database that gathers information from every college and institution that participates in federal student aid programs.

```{r}
#| label: import_data
#| include: false
# code written by Gabriel Cabrera
ebirds <- read_csv("EBbird_IPEDS_UNITID_MEPANCFL_Jan23-May23_v3.csv")
ipeds <- read_csv("IPEDS_combined_MEPANCFL_v4.csv")
#Reading the data formatted in Excel
```

## Bird Species Richness and Impervious Surfaces

Bird species richness looks at how many different bird species there are at each campus. Impervious surfaces is identified as a continuous metric representing the percentage of mean impervious surface cover within a 0.5km radius around the recorded IPEDS lat/long for the institution derived from 2019 NLCD (National Land Cover Data).



```{r}
#| label: species_richness
# code written by Gabriel Cabrera

ebirds$`OBSERVATION COUNT` <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", ebirds$`OBSERVATION COUNT`))
#makes sure all observations are numerical 


# summarization and join
combined_data <- ebirds |>
  group_by(UNITID, `COMMON NAME`) |>
  summarise(
    total_observations = sum(`OBSERVATION COUNT`, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  group_by(UNITID) |>
  summarise(
    species_richness = n_distinct(`COMMON NAME`),
    total_observations_all = sum(total_observations),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(UNITID, desc(total_observations_all))

#this finds the species richness as well as the total observations of each college campus
```

Now we want to join this with the IPEDS data to find the relationship between bird species richness and impervious surfaces

```{r}
#| label: join
# code written by Gabriel Cabrera
ebirds_ipeds_impervious <- combined_data |>
  left_join(ipeds, by = "UNITID") |>
  select(UNITID, INSTNM, species_richness, mean_impervious) |>
  distinct(UNITID, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  drop_na()

#join with IPEDS dataset by distinct key "UNITID" keeping 
```

We predict that those colleges and universities with a higher amount of impervious surface covering the ground will have a lower biodiversity of bird species.


```{r}
#| label: richness_impervious_main
#| fig-cap: add caption
# code authored by Gabriel Cabrera
ggplot(ebirds_ipeds_impervious, aes(y = species_richness, x = mean_impervious)) +
  geom_bin2d() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between species richness and impervious surfaces",
    subtitle = "Institutions are limited to locations in Maine, Pennyslvania, North Carolina, and Florida",
    x = "Impervious Surfaces",
    y = "Species Richness"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
#A heatmap point graph is created using ggplots package
```

### What is the relationship?

There is no strong correlation between bird species richness and impervious surface. Performing a log transform on mean species richness, mean impervious, or both doesn’t affect the relationship significantly.

Some species of bird have adapted to living in urban areas. For example, rock pigeons (Columba livia) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus), both of which are found in the eBird dataset, commonly live in urban areas. The inclusion of these species may mask the richness trends aligned with our hypothesis. 

The relationship does vary by taxonomic order. When looking at the relationship between the bird species richness of each taxonomic order and the impervious surface we can see that majority of the orders do not have a significant relationship as the average species richness does not vary as impervious surface increases. However, with the Passeriformes order the species richness tends to vary with the impervious surface without showing any clear relationship.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Graduation Rate and Bird Species Richness

A rich biodiverse campus is linked to better well-being of students, often resulting in academic persistence. Does having a rich bird biodiversity result in a higher graduation rate?

```{r}
#| label: richness_grad_join
# code authored by Gabriel Cabrera
unitid_state <- ipeds |>
  group_by(UNITID) |>
  summarise(STATE = STABBR.x)

#There are many data points in this data so lets look at this state by state

grrttot_bird <- combined_data |>
  left_join(ipeds, by = "UNITID") |>
  left_join(unitid_state, by = "UNITID") |>
  left_join(ebirds, by = "UNITID") |>
  select(UNITID, GRRTTOT, species_richness, `COMMON NAME`, STATE) |>
  distinct(UNITID, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  drop_na()
#A join between several tables was done to find the graduation rate and species richness, allowing us to plot this data
```


```{r}
#| label: richness_grad_plot
#| fig-cap: add caption
# code written by Gabriel Cabrera
ggplot(grrttot_bird, aes(x = GRRTTOT, species_richness)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = `COMMON NAME`)) +
  facet_wrap(~STATE) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(
    title = "Bird Species Richness and Graduation Rate by State",
    x = "Bird Species Richness",
    y = "Graduation Rate",
    subtitle = "Most common species per institution is shown through color"
  )

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Institution size

A larger institution should have the resources to create a diverse range of habitats, likely supporting higher bird biodiversity. Do larger universities support a higher bird species richness?

In the IPEDS dataset, institution size was reported as the size of the student population enrolled in classes in the fall of 2012.

```{r}
#| label: richness_size
#| fig-cap: There is a slight increase in species richness as the size of the student population increases, but the many outliers may skew the data and mask a stronger relationship.
# code written by Lilah Shtino


ebirds_ipeds_size <- combined_data |>
  left_join(ipeds, by = "UNITID") |>
  select(UNITID, species_richness, INSTSIZE, mean_impervious) |>
  distinct(UNITID, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  drop_na() |> 
  mutate(INSTSIZE = as.character(INSTSIZE))

# changes the observation names for the legend
ebirds_ipeds_size$INSTSIZE <- factor(ebirds_ipeds_size$INSTSIZE,
                                     labels = c("1" = "under 1,000",
                                                "2" = "1,000 - 4,999",
                                                "3" = "5,000 - 9,999",
                                                "4" = "10,000 - 19,999",
                                                "5" = "20,000 and above"))


# boxplot with the species richness compared to the size of the institution/student population
ggplot(ebirds_ipeds_size, aes(y = species_richness, x = INSTSIZE, fill = INSTSIZE)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Student Population size",
       y = "Species Richness",
       title = "Relationship between institution size and bird species richness") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### Accounting for Impervious Surface Coverage
Is there a discernible relationship between the species richness and impervious surfaces across institution size?

```{r}
#| label: richness_imperv_size
#| fig-cap: Data points represent individual institutions, color-coded by enrollment size. Smoothed trend lines illustrate how biodiversity varies with increasing impervious surface area for each institution size category.
#| # code written by Lilah Shtino

# creates scatterplot of species richness and impervious surfaces with smoothed lines for each institution size
ebirds_ipeds_size |> 
  rename("Student population size" = INSTSIZE) |> 
  ggplot(aes( x = mean_impervious, y = species_richness, color = `Student population size`)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.5)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  guides(alpha = "none") +
  labs(title = "Biodiversity and impervious surface coverage across institution sizes",
       x = "Impervious Surfaces",
       y = "Species Richness")
```

There is no obvious relationship when factoring in impervious surfaces to species richness across institution sizes. However, the trend lines show that for institutions with the largest amount of impervious surfaces, species richness does increase with increasing student population sizes with the exception of institutions with under 1,000 students. Interestingly, the trend lines show that the smallest institutions with the largest amount of impervious surfaces have the highest species richness compared to other all other institution sizes.
