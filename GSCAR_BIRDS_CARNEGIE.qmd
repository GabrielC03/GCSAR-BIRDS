#### Exploring the Relationship between Carnegie Classification and Bird Species Richness

#### Accounting for Taxonomic Order and Impervious Surface along with Carnegie Classification

Create a data frame grouping similar institutions for simplicity:

```{r}
combined_carnegie_grouped <- ipeds |> 
  left_join(avg_richness_order_college, by = "UNITID") |>
  mutate(CARNEGIE = as.character(CARNEGIE)) |>
  select(UNITID, INSTNM, CARNEGIE, ORDER, mean_species_richness, mean_impervious) |>
  mutate(
    CARNEGIE_GROUP = case_when(
      str_detect(CARNEGIE, "15|16") ~ "Doctoral",
      str_detect(CARNEGIE, "21|22") ~ "Master's",
      str_detect(CARNEGIE, "31|32") ~ "Baccalaureate",
      str_detect(CARNEGIE, "33") ~ "B/A",
      str_detect(CARNEGIE, "40") ~ "Associates",
      str_detect(CARNEGIE, "51|52|55|56|57|59") ~ "Specialized",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_species_richness))
combined_carnegie_grouped
```

Plot Carnegie classification vs. average species richness, organized by taxonomic order:

```{r}
combined_carnegie_grouped |>
  filter(!is.na(ORDER)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = CARNEGIE_GROUP, y = mean_species_richness, fill = ORDER)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Plot average species richness vs. average impervious surface, by Carnegie classification:

```{r}
combined_carnegie_grouped |>
  ggplot(aes(y = mean_species_richness, x = mean_impervious)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~CARNEGIE_GROUP)
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between species richness and impervious surfaces",
    x = "Impervious Surfaces",
    y = "Species Richness"
  )
```
